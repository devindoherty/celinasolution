	A preface: There will be bugs. Quite a few probably. What I’ve found out about programming of any sort, but especially with games, is that I alone cannot account for every single possible avenue a player will go down. I think it’s rather easy to break The Celina Solution, some the mechanics aren’t exactly tamper proof.
	The personality module mechanic is especially cobbled together. I think it works mostly as intended, but seeing as how there are over 30 discreet combinations of modules that can be installed or uninstalled, there very well might be unintended consequences.
	The personality of the AI character Celina is the central gameplay elements. I’ve included the source text in the game’s website, so take a look. That took quite a lot of mucking about to get working, and I’m certain there’s much more elegant and efficient ways of doing so.
	If you’re playing and you encounter any bugs please let me know. I’d like to try and iron out any of them, if I can. If you get stuck, I’ve included an introduction with the rest of the game materials.
